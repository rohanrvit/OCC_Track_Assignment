    Back in 1919, an aspiring young cartoonist was fired from his job at a Kansas City newspaper.
     His editor told him he wasn’t creative enough and should look into work elsewhere.
      Had the cartoonist listened to his boss and given in to negative thinking, we wouldn’t have the work of Walt Disney.
 
    Disney might have considered quitting or going after a different line of work, but he persisted.
     He believed he had what it took to succeed, and listened to the voice inside himself urging him to keep trying.
      He turned to the power of positive thinking, which encouraged him to go after success instead of succumbing to his fear of failure.
     You can adopt this mindset and experience all the benefits of positive thinking in your own life.
